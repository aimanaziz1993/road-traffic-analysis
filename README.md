## üöÄ Key Features & Enhancements

This dashboard is built with several advanced features to provide precise, actionable intelligence:

### üß† Advanced Scoring Model
Instead of just relying on raw traffic, the application calculates a proprietary **`LocationPotentialScore`**. This powerful metric provides a more accurate assessment of a location's business potential by intelligently weighting multiple factors:
-   **Traffic Index:** The foundational metric for volume.
-   **Road Type:** A critical multiplier that favors accessible secondary roads over high-speed expressways.
-   **Speed Limit:** Lower speeds are scored higher, reflecting increased driver visibility and impulse-stop potential.
-   **Number of Lanes & Direction:** Modifiers that account for traffic volume and accessibility from multiple directions.

### üó∫Ô∏è Dynamic & Interactive Map View
-   **Multiple Map Layers:** Users can instantly switch between two visualization modes for deeper analysis:
    -   **Lines View:** Renders road segments colored by their `LocationPotentialScore`, from red (low potential) to green (high potential).
    -   **Heatmap View:** Provides an intuitive, high-level overview of location potential "hotspots" across a region.
-   **Accurate Geospatial Analysis:** The heatmap is not based on simple start/end points. The backend performs **geospatial interpolation** to generate a dense series of points along the entire length of each road, resulting in a highly accurate and practical visualization.
-   **Animated Map Transitions:** When an analysis is run, the map smoothly "flies" and zooms to fit the results, providing a polished and intuitive user experience.
-   **Modern Dark Theme:** Utilizes dark-themed map tiles that blend seamlessly with the dashboard UI.

### ‚ú® Modern Intelligence UI
-   **Dark Theme & Glassmorphism:** The UI is designed to look like a modern intelligence dashboard, using a dark theme with floating, blurred "glass" panels that are less obstructive to the map view.
-   **Fetch on Load:** The dashboard is immediately useful, automatically loading and displaying a region-wide analysis the moment the page is opened.
-   **Rich, Data-Driven Panels:** The results panel clearly displays the `LocationPotentialScore` with a visual bar, along with the key factors that contributed to the ranking.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Robust Tech Stack
-   **Backend:** .NET 8 API using **NetTopologySuite** for professional-grade geospatial processing and a custom-built scoring engine.
-   **Frontend:** A fast, modern, and type-safe frontend built with **Vite, React, and TypeScript**.
-   **State Management:** Centralized and predictable state management with **Redux Toolkit and RTK Query**.

## The Scoring Model in Detail

The `LocationPotentialScore` is calculated using the following weighted model:

| Factor          | Logic                                                       | Weight / Multiplier |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Traffic Index** | The base score for raw traffic volume.                      | 40%                 |
| **Speed Limit**   | A normalized score rewarding lower, high-visibility speeds. | 30%                 |
| **Lanes**         | A score that rewards higher lane counts (volume).           | 15%                 |
| **Direction**     | A bonus for `two_way` streets (better accessibility).       | 15%                 |
| **Road Type**     | **Critical Multiplier** applied to the final score.       | `x1.2` for Secondary, `x1.0` for Primary, `x0.5` for Expressway |

## üèÅ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
-   [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running on your system (macOS, Windows, or Linux).

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

### 2. Build and Run the Application
From the project's root directory (where `docker-compose.yml` is located), run the following command:
```bash
docker compose up --build```
-   The `--build` flag is essential for the first run or after any code changes.
-   The initial build may take a few minutes to download the necessary Docker images and install all dependencies.

### 3. Access the Application
Once the containers are running, you can access the different parts of the application:

-   **üìç Main Dashboard (Frontend):**
    -   **URL: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**

-   **‚öôÔ∏è Backend API (Swagger UI):**
    -   **URL: [http://localhost:5050/swagger](http://localhost:5050/swagger)**

### 4. Stopping the Application
To stop all running containers, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where Docker Compose is running. To remove the containers and network, run:
```bash
docker compose down
```
